        PROLOGUE

</p>
<p id="style-text">
    Two households, both alike in dignity,
<BR>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
<BR>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
<BR>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
<BR>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
<BR>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
<BR>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
<BR>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
<BR>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
<BR>And the continuance of their parents' rage,
<BR>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
<BR>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
<BR>The which if you with patient ears attend,
<BR>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
